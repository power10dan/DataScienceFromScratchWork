# DataScienceFromScratchWork
My attempt at implementing the code from Data Science From Scratch by Joel Grus. 
This work is written in Python. I tried to re-implement some of the codes
found in Joel Grus's book. For example, in the first chapter, Joel
used an array to implement a friend suggester. I reimplemented that 
code using a connectivity tree.
